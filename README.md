# Penguin Run

### Game Description
- A combination of platformer and obstacle dodging 2D game. The player controls a penguin and runs away from a hungry polar bear that is trying to catch up to the player. The player must control the penguin to dodge obstacles like seals, ice shards, and the dark ocean where danger awaits. The goal of the game is to reach the destination in the end without being caught up by the hungry polar bear or eaten by the seals. There is also a score accumulation in the end depending on how many snow flakes and fishes the player collects throughout the game.
